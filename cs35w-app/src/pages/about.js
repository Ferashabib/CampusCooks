      <h3 className="card">Many people begin to cook for themselves only when they come to college, and our project is aimed at diminishing many of the common hurdles that these students encounter. Our web application is designed specifically for college students, with the goal of providing simple, cost-effective recipes to the user. The main functionality of our application is a cost based recipe search, which allows the user to find recipes within a certain budget based on the summed average cost of the ingredients. Recent studies have found that over 70% of college students feel stressed about their finances, and our web app hopes to alleviate this by creating an easy to use budgeting tool. Cooking for the first time can be a daunting experience, so our web app will also prioritize recipes that use few ingredients and are simple to make.
